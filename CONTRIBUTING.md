### Make sure to read these guidelines before contributing your own packs.

### If any of the points in this format are not followed, your pull request <b>will</b> be declined.

1. Make sure that your pack is distributed in `.mcpack` format, not `.zip`

2. Make sure that your pack file is named appropriately

3. Ensure that your pack works with the latest release of OSBES

4. You **must** have a description and at least 2 screenshots for your pack showing what you changed

5. Your descriptions must be truthful

6. Your pack must be original, and not something that has already been done by yourself or another submitter

7. Your preset must have an original name:

  a. Your preset's name must not include "OSBES" as the main part of the name, however you are allowed to use it to indicate that your preset is a port (For example, "Vanilla Normals Renewed for OSBES")
  
  b. Your preset must not be the same as or extremely similar to an existing preset
